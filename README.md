# Sentiment Analysis with LSTM in PyTorch

This project implements a **sentiment analysis model** using an LSTM network in PyTorch to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative.

##  Reference & Methodology

The project leverages the core concepts of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for sequence modeling in NLP tasks. The methodology follows these steps:

* **Data Preparation** – Load the IMDB dataset, tokenize text, build vocabulary, and numerize data.
* **Model Design** – Build a bidirectional LSTM with embedding and dropout layers.
* **Training** – Use CrossEntropyLoss and Adam optimizer with mini-batches.
* **Evaluation** – Measure accuracy and loss on validation and test datasets.
* **Prediction** – Test the trained model on new sentences.

##  Key Features

* LSTM-based sentiment classifier
* Bidirectional LSTM for better context understanding
* Custom data loader with padding support
* Training and evaluation loop with progress visualization
* Prediction function for arbitrary input text

## 📊 Results

The model progressively learns to classify movie reviews accurately. Training and validation loss/accuracy are visualized over epochs.

Example of testing on new sentences:

| Sentence                                      | Predicted Sentiment | Probability |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------|
| "This film is terrible!"                      | Negative            | 0.95       |
| "This film is great!"                         | Positive            | 0.92       |
| "This film is not terrible, it's great!"      | Positive            | 0.88       |
| "Not recommended"                             | Negative            | 0.91       |
